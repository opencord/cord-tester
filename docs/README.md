# Testing CORD

CORD Tester is an automation framework that has been developed to test
features of CORD.

CORD Tester framework can be installed on the POD directly or a standalone node
that can access POD to run various tests. Cord-tester framework is modular,
making it easy to test all the components that make up CORD.
It supports end-to-end tests, functional tests and api tests for SEBA
components.  The suite of tests is constantly evolving with more features and
tests.
